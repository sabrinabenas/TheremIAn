 1. Mouse-based Continuous Sound
Uses Pygame to track mouse position (X-axis) for real-time pitch control.

Smooth continuous frequency changes.

Waveform visualized on-screen.

▶ Main file: positionmouseSound_cont.py
▶ Key libraries: pygame, pyaudio, numpy

---

2. Mouse-based Spectrum Sound
Similar to the continuous version but adds richer harmonics (partial overtones).

Optional: Pentatonic scale mapping (commented in code).

Waveform visualization and real-time sound response.

▶ Main file: positionmouseSound_Spectrum.py
▶ Key libraries: pygame, pyaudio, numpy, numba (optional for performance)
